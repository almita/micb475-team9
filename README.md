# micb475-team9

## meetings

### Meeting 1 - 01/FEB/2024
#### notes
- Discuss datasets that other groups are looking into
- Want to explore dataset that is not heavily studied in MICB 475
- Considering the Starch Resistant Dataset → received research paper from Evelyn from last term
- Considering Wetland dataset → no research groups have looked into
- For next meeting: select dataset, compose potential research questions

### Meeting 2 - 08/FEB/2024
#### agenda
- marine microbiome datasets
- diabetic and children gut microbiome datasets
- decide datasets and research questions

#### notes
- validate mouse microbiome model vs human microbiome:
	- compare first within cohort then between cohorts
	- a good model would cluster very similarly
	- if the datasets are different (paired vs single end reads) we need to process them separately until we get to the table.qzv
		- qiime has a merging function, Dr. Evelyn will send us a tutorial for it
	- if we find that the model is bad we need to reach out to the researchers just to let them know that we're going to be "criticizing" their paper
- record everything we do to clean up the metadata
- get a head start on the metadata
